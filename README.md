# Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) using Deep Learning

This repository contains experiments on **Facial Emotion Recognition** using two datasets:
1. **KTFE Dataset** â€“ trained using AlexNet
2. **Proposed Dataset** â€“ trained using ResNet18

We evaluated and compared the performance of different models, achieving up to **72.1% accuracy on KTFE**.
